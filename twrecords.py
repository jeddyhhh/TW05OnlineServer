"""Every round anyone has played, and what can be said about them.

    python twrecords.py            # self-test

Head-to-head matches (`results`, resolved through `twdb.matches`) and
tournament rounds (`tourney`) are recorded in different shapes by different
code paths.  `rounds()` folds both into one list of plain dicts, one per player
per round, and everything else here -- a player's page, the stat leaders, the
records, the course pages, the in-game news -- is a function of that list.  One
list, so the web site and the news screen cannot disagree about who holds a
record.

WHAT COUNTS

Only rounds a player finished: `DONE` set, `QUIT` clear, some holes played.
Scoring figures (averages, low rounds, course records) use 18-hole rounds only
-- a Front 9 is not comparable with a full round.  Per-hole figures (greens,
fairways, putts, birdies) use every finished hole, scaled to 18.

WHAT IS NOT BELIEVED

The console reports what it reports.  One real tournament card came in with
`PUTTS=1025` for eighteen holes, so every number is range-checked and anything
impossible becomes None -- left out of averages and records, never shown as a
record.  `clean()` holds the limits.
