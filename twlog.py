"""One log file per server, capped in size.  Standard library only.

    python twlog.py            # self-test

`lobbyd` logs every frame it sends and receives, and nothing ever trimmed
that: a five-minute two-player session wrote 33 KB, and under `tw04.sh` the
same lines were written twice -- once by lobbyd to its own file and once more
through stdout into the supervisor's.  This writes each line once, to one file,
and when that file passes `max_bytes` it rolls over:

    lobbyd.log  ->  lobbyd.log.1  ->  lobbyd.log.2 ... up to `keep`

so the disk used is bounded by `max_bytes * (keep + 1)`.  No logrotate, no
cron job, nothing installed -- the same rule as the rest of the server.

`echo` also prints each line, for running by hand in a terminal.  Under a
supervisor that already sends stdout to the same file, turn it off (`--quiet`)
or every line lands twice again.
