"""The TW04 packed-record codec: the `S` statistics blob and `CRPIN` golfers.

Two layers, both read straight out of the ELF.

LAYER 1 -- high-bit escaping (`0x002736C0`)

The wire form must survive a text field, so no byte may be NUL.  The record is
therefore carried in groups of eight: one mask byte followed by **seven**
payload bytes, with bit *n* of the mask supplying the top bit of payload byte
*n*.  Every transmitted byte has its own top bit set, so none can be zero.

    0x00273710  t0 = *group                       ; the mask byte
    0x00273714  v1 = (1 << n) & t0
    0x00273724  if v1: *dst = *payload |  0x80
    0x00273738  else:  *dst = *payload & ~0x80
    0x0027374C  slti v1, t2, 7                    ; SEVEN per group, not eight

The captured 665-byte `CRPIN` blob is exactly 83 groups plus a trailing `'!'`,
which is what confirms the group size.

LAYER 2 -- bit fields (`0x00273780`)

The decoded bytes are a little-endian bit stream, LSB first, carved into 56
fields by the table at `0x00302440`.  A field's offset is the sum of every
earlier field's width; there is no padding and no alignment.

    0x002738C8  v1 = word[a0] & (1 << t3)
    0x002738F8  if v1: v0 |= (1 << a3)            ; LSB first
    0x00273900  t3 += 1; at 32 move on a word

THE MARKER

`0x00276C34` refuses the whole record unless the byte at `ctx+0xF4` is `'!'` --
that is `S + 0x78`, immediately after the fifteen groups the statistics record
uses.  Without it every value on the resume screen falls back to the defaults in
the table, which is why the screen read zero however the fields were filled.
