"""The TW04 master server's database.  sqlite3 from the standard library.

One file, no server process, no dependencies.  `lobbyd` and the web front end
both open it; sqlite's own locking keeps them honest, and WAL mode means a
reader never blocks the writer.

    python twdb.py --create-account alice --password secret1
    python twdb.py --list

The default path is <project>/data/tw05.db, anchored to this file rather than
to the working directory, so every tool opens the same one wherever it is run
from.

THE SHAPE OF AN EA ACCOUNT

The client's login is two steps and the database mirrors them exactly:

    auth NAME=<account> PASS=<enciphered>   ->  PERSONAS=<comma-separated>
    pers PERS=<one of those>

So an **account** is the credential and a **persona** is the name other players
see.  `_AuthCallback` (0x00287590) parses `PERSONAS` with a ',' separator into
four 32-byte slots, so an account may hold at most four and each is at most 31
characters.

A persona also owns a **golfer** -- the Create-A-Player blob the client uploads
with `cusr whomi` and the opponent fetches with `user`.  That is what makes your
player follow you between consoles, so it belongs here rather than in memory.
