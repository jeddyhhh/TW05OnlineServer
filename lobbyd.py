"""The TW04 master server: lobby, rooms, matchmaking and results.

    python lobbyd.py

Two consoles can log in, see each other, create and join rooms, chat, challenge
each other, get handed each other's address for the peer-to-peer game, and
report the round afterwards.  Accounts live in twdb.py, shared with the
sign-up site in webui.py.

It began as a measuring instrument and can still log every frame in both raw
and decoded form (-v), which is how the protocol was worked out.  Replies that
are still guesses say so in the handler that sends them.

PASSWORDS ARE NOT LOGGED.  Neither the plaintext nor the ciphertext -- with the
session key being a fixed constant below, one is as good as the other.
--log-passwords turns that off for working on the cipher; it writes real
credentials into a plain file, so use it against accounts you own and delete
the log afterwards.
